## Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has received increased attention over the past decades with the potential to non-invasively treat cancer via light exposure. Due to the limited light penetration depth (typically less than 1 cm), the PDT optical fiber typically needs to be placed close to the cancerous region to ensure the treatment outcome. In this paper, we present a novel soft robot laparoscope design that enables accurate and safe deployment of PDT optical fiber for pancreatic tumor treatment. To achieve this, the proposed soft robot is able to produce 3 degrees of freedom (DoF) motions: linear translation, in-plane bending, and axial rotation. A micro camera is integrated with the soft robot to provide intraoperative image guidance during the procedure. The robot forward kinematics model was obtained via a generalized calibration method, and the differential kinematics was derived analytically. Benchtop characterization results indicated that the soft robot was able to achieve 1.4 ± 0.4 mm position and 1.5 ± 1.1 degrees orientation accuracy, respectively. The robot was experimentally validated in two \textit{in vivo} mice models, and the results indicated that the proposed system successfully reduced the tumor size from 15.3 mm3 and 11.8 mm3 to 12.1 mm3 and 4.4 mm3 respectively.
