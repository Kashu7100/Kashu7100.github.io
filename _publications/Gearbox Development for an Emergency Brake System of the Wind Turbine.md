## Abstract
The article justifies the need to use independent power supply sources in the Arctic regions. It gives arguments in favour of using wind-driven power plants as autonomous power sources. It describes the problems of operating wind energy equipment in the arctic climate. As a solution of the above operational problems, it is proposed to use an emergency brake system in wind power plants. We proposed a design of an emergency brake system exemplified by a 3 kW vertical-axial wind turbine. We calculated the gearbox parameters for the proposed design and created a computer model of the gearbox based on the obtained parameters. We also analysed the advantages of the developed gearbox and the design of the emergency brake system in general.
