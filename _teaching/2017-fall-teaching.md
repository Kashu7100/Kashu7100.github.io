## Lecture Information
<b>Text Book:</b> Jong, I. C., Engineering Mechanics: Statics, Second Edition, 2013, Great River Learning, Debuque, IA. 

### Grades
9 collections of homework (each worth 5 points), 6 quizzes (each worth 10 points), 3 tests (each worth 100 points), n pop quizzes (each worth 5 pts), and a final exam (worth 100points). The total score you can possibly earn in this course may, therefore, be 505 + 5n points.

## Important Topics
### Principle of Moments (POM)
1. Resultant = sum of components
2. Moment of resultant = sum of moments of components

### Parallel-Axis Theorem (PAT)
The moment of inertia of a body about a given axis is related to the moment of inertia about a centroidal axis parallel to the given axis as follows:

### Work
**Work** is energy in transition to a system due to *force or moment* acting on the system through a displacement. Note that **Heat** is energy in transition to a system due to *temperature difference* between the system and its surroundings. Work differs from energy in that workis nota property possessed by a system, while energy (e.g., kinetic energy or potential energy) is. Work is a boundary phenomenon.

### Virtual Work Method

Three major steps for [virtual work method](https://icjong.hosted.uark.edu/docu/05Portland.ppt.pdf):
1. Draw the free-body (FBD) diagram. 
2. Draw the virtual-displacement diagram (VDD) with a strategy, which gives the free body a compatible virtual displacement in such a way that the one specified unknown, but no other unknowns, will be involved in the virtual work done.
3. Set the total virtual work done to zero in order to solve for the unknown.
