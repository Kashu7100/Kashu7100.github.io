Important Topics
---
Three major steps for [virtual work method](https://icjong.hosted.uark.edu/docu/05Portland.ppt.pdf):
1. Draw the free-body (FBD) diagram. 
2. Draw the virtual-displacement diagram (VDD) with a strategy.
> strategy: give the free body a compatible virtual displacementin such a way that the onespecified unknown, but no other unknowns, will be involved in the virtual work done
3. Set the total virtual work done to zero in order to solve for the unknown.
