David J. Chalmers, an Australian philosopher and cognitive scientist, onece argued that if a system reproduces the functional organization of the brain, it will also reproduce the qualia associated with the brain in the paper "Absent Qualia, Fading Qualia, Dancing Qualia." This library "Qualia" named after the series of arguments in philosophy of mind associated with the qualia, hoping for the creation of a system with subjective consciousness.

Qualia is a deep learning framework deeply integrated with automatic differentiation and dynamic graphing with CUDA acceleration. Thanks to the define-by-run API, the code written with Qualia enjoys high modularity.
