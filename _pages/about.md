About Me
======
- I am a research assistant in the [Computer Science](https://computer-science-and-computer-engineering.uark.edu/) Department advised by Dr. [Ngan Le](https://www.nganle.net/) at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. Previously, I was advised by Dr. [Yue Chen](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Yue-Chen) in the Mechanical Engineering Department. 

- I received a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering in 2020 from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville with *Summa Cum Laude*.

- My research interests focus on deep learning and robotics. In particular, I am interested in human/animal intelligence and locomotion, and replicating the intelligent behavior in machines.

- Fun fact: I personally own Go1 Edu by Unitree as my pet.
