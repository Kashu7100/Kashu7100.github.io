About Me
======
- I am a research assistant in the [Computer Science](https://computer-science-and-computer-engineering.uark.edu/) Department advised by Dr. [Ngan Le](https://www.nganle.net/) at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.

- I received a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering in 2020 from University of Arkansas, Fayetteville with *Summa Cum Laude*.

- My research interests focus on deep learning and robotics. In particular, I am interested in the human/animal intelligence and locomotion, and replicating the intelligent behavior in machines.

- Outside of research, I also have experiences working on both software and hardware for robotics and deep learning related projects.
