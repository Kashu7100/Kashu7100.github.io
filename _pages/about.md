About me
======
- Undergraduate research assistant in the [Mechanical Engineering](https://mechanical-engineering.uark.edu/) Department at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, advised by Dr. [Yue Chen](https://mechanical-engineering.uark.edu/Directory/index/uid/yc039/name/Yue+Chen/) and Dr. [Ngan Le](https://engineering.uark.edu/directory/index/uid/thile/name/Thi+Hoang+Ngan+Le/).

- My research interests focus on deep learning, robotics, and computational neuroscience. In particular, I am interested in the human intelligence and locomotion, and replicating the intelligent behavior in machines.

- Outside of research, I also have experiences working on both software and hardware for robotics and deep learning related projects.
