About Me
======
I am a research associate at the [AICV lab](https://uark-aicv.github.io/) led by Dr. [Ngan Le](https://www.nganle.net/) at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. 
Concurrently, I am serving as a visiting researcher at the [Machine Learning for Signal Processing Group](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/), led by Dr. [Bhiksha Raj](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/bhiksha/), within the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

My academic journey includes a Master's degree in Computer Science, conferred in 2023, with a research focus on vision-and-language integration, mentored by Dr. [Ngan Le](https://www.nganle.net/). 
This followed a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, achieved in 2020 from the same institution, where I graduated *Summa Cum Laude* (highest honors).
